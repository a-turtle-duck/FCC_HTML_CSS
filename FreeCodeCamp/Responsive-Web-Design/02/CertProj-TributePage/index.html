      <div id="tribute-info"> <h2>Early Life (1867–1891)</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie was born Maria Skłodowska on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, under Russian control. Raised in a family that valued education, she excelled in academics despite facing financial hardships. After the death of her mother, she moved to Paris in 1891 to continue her studies at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. During this time, she adopted the French version of her name, Marie.</p>

      <div id="tribute-info"> <h2>Scientific Beginnings(1891–1895)</h2>
        <p>Marie’s passion for research deepened when she met Pierre Curie, a physicist, in 1894. They married in 1895, forming one of science’s most famous partnerships. Their collaboration was pivotal in exploring the phenomenon of radioactivity. Marie’s early work focused on the magnetic properties of steel, but her groundbreaking research began when she was tasked with investigating the mysterious rays emitted by the element pitchblende, which led to the discovery of radium and polonium in 1898.</p>

      <div id="tribute-info"> <h2>Pioneering Discoveries (1898–1906)</h2>
        <p>Together with Pierre, Marie’s research into radioactivity resulted in the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium, in 1898. In 1903, she shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Henri Becquerel for their work on radiation. Marie Curie’s breakthrough contributed significantly to the field of atomic physics and earned her the first-ever Nobel awarded to a woman. In 1904, Marie took a position at the University of Paris, becoming the first woman to teach there.</p>

      <div id="tribute-info"> <h2>Tragedy and Continued Work (1906–1914)</h2>
        <p>In 1906, tragedy struck when Pierre was killed in a traffic accident. Despite her grief, Marie continued her scientific work, focusing on the medical applications of radium. Her efforts during World War I, where she developed mobile X-ray units to aid in battlefield medical care, were revolutionary. Her work saved countless lives and solidified her legacy as a pioneer in both science and humanitarian efforts.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tribute-info"> <h2>Later Years and Legacy (1914–1934)</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie continued her research until her death from aplastic anemia, likely caused by her prolonged exposure to radiation, in 1934. Her legacy lives on in her groundbreaking discoveries and her contributions to science, particularly the field of radioactivity. She remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911). Her achievements opened doors for future generations of women in science.</p>
